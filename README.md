# Data Visualization: Labor Productivity & Earnings

### Essential Question:
How does the increasing worker productivity correlate with their earnings? Are workers benefiting from increasing productivity?

### Data Sources:
* [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via FRED (OPHNFB)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OPHNFB) - Labor productivity (output / hour) over the years from 1941 to 2024.
* [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via FRED (LES1252881600Q)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q) - Real earnings of workers from 1979 to 2024. The data takes inflation into account by using the Consumer Price Index.
* [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via FRED (COMPRNFB)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/COMPRNFB) - Real hourly compensation from 1947 to 2024. Since this included more than just wages/salaries, this real hourly compensation might give a more accurate picture.

### Potential Visualizations:
* **Line Graph:** Earnings & productivity plotted together (y-axis, left and right) vs. year (x-axis) - Showing rate of change or how much each one is increasing for each year
    * Can also include the real compensation to see if a similar trend exists.
* **Scatter Plot:** A scatter plot also can be utilized to display the data and showing a line of best fit to show the trend.
